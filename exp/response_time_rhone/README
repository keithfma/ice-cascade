Experiment: Glacier Response Time for the Rhone Valley

Description: Explore the relaxation to steady-state of a model glacial system in the Rhone
  valley in response to a step change in climate. The goal is to solve for a
  characteristic time and ultimately to be able to assess the applicability of a
  quasi-steady-state assumption in future modelling work.

Workflow:

  1) Prepare ICE-CASCADE input file for the initial steady-state model
    a. Download source data (run srtm/download_raw.sh)
    b. Extract model domain topography at the desired resolution (edit and run
      topo_from_srtm.py)

  2) Integrate the initial steady state model

  3) Prepare step-change test model input files

  4) Integrate step-change test models

  5) Aggregate and analyze results
